# AI Multi-Agent System - Session Logs

## Session 2: Nov 19, 2025 ✅ COMPLETE

**What was done:**
- ✅ Phase 6C.1: Outlier Detection function added
- ✅ Fixed correlation_engine.py syntax errors
- ✅ Added logging import
- ✅ Correlation analysis working end-to-end
- ✅ Results displaying in UI

**Commits:**
- Phase 6C.1: Correlation analysis engine - Working with logging

**Current Status:** Working ✅
- Correlation analysis running
- Results showing (Best Model, Accuracy, Features Ranked)
- No outlier detection messages yet (to be fixed in Phase 6C.2)

**Known Issues:**
- Outlier detection not showing in results
- Need to add outlier_detection to return dict properly
- Visualizations pending for Phase 6C.2

**Next Session (Tomorrow):**
1. Fix outlier detection to show warnings
2. Phase 6C.2: Visualizations (scatter plots, heatmaps)
3. Phase 6C.3: Fix "Save for Future"
4. Phase 7: Time-Series Prediction

## Phase 6C.2: COMPLETE ✅
- Correlation analysis working with 7 ML models
- Outlier detection with IQR method
- Dynamic results based on different inputs
- Severity classification (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/NONE)
- Ready for Phase 6C.3: Visualizations

## Phase 6C.3: READY TO START
- Model performance comparison chart
- Feature importance visualization
- Outlier distribution box plot
- Correlation heatmap
